Used to immitate typing on the keyboard, automatically and continuously. Uses looping scrips to perform typing
immitations with a start and stop command hotkey. In addition, the auto presser can be used to perform typing
strings and sentences with ease automatically. You can easily change the hotkeys that start and stop the 
auto typer within the main.py script, including changing the hotkey that will be used to immitate typing
or key presses.
